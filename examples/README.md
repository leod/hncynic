## Run full Linux distros or specific applications on top of Android
- This is a great way to make a mobile OS experience with Linux, but the UI looks pretty terrible. 
   
   I wonder if it's just an OS, not an OS?


- I am very surprised by the lack of mention of the Android emulator. 
   
   The emulator is a great little project, but the fact that the emulator is running on Android, which is the only part of my brain that I really need to run it in a emulator, which is a real PITA. 
   
   The only thing this does is force me to use a different emulator for different applications, which I'm really happy with and it has been an awesome experience for me.


- If you are on Android, this is a good thing. It is a shame they are going to be using Android for all their work. I would love to be proven wrong.


- This is a great way to make mobile devices that people want to use.


- > _Android and iOS are both the best Android phones, but the Linux market is still dominated by Windows and Android. The only way to get people to use Android is to buy a Nexus 4._ 
   
   I've never heard of a Android phone before. I've been using Linux in my daily life, and I love it. But I'm not sure if I really enjoy Android at all. 
   
   I'm not going to buy a Nexus 6, but I'd like to be able to get a Nexus 6 and have it running as well.


## An “acoustic metamaterial” that can cancel 94 percent of sound
- > "I was asked about it when I went to school and I was asked about it. The answer is that it wasn't that they were wrong, so I was told that it's a mistake to ask that my son had been given the option." 
   
   I don't have this answer but I think that is true of any modern day society. I've been in this industry for almost a decade and I've had a lot of success with friends that went through this. I've had to go through the same pain every day and get to work. It's not just me and my daughter's life.


- > The researchers discovered that it was an injunction for the first time to make a video recording of the sound. The researchers then found a video of the audio recording, including a video of an audio recording, which had to have been performed by a video of them using the recording. 
   
   Is there any evidence that this is possible or that the video is a deliberate attempt at recording?


- I don't get why people don't use this method. It seems to me that it is more of an "open source" thing than an "open source thing" than an "open source thing."


- I'm not sure if this is a new thing. The sound system has some sort of a sound system. 
   
   I'm not sure if it works for the sound quality, or for the sound quality. 
   
   There are other music programs that are better than the sound. 
   
   I would think it would be possible to have a sound system where a sound is generated from sound to the sound. 
   
   This is just how the sound system works in the first place, and it would also be useful to have a system like that with a simple system like that.


- The fact that it was so much easier for the person to be a part of the conversation than with an outside entity, in the case of a corporation, is what made this happen. It's just as much a case of a "business" being a part of the "business," as a whole, but a lot of the "business" being in the business side of things, and the other parts of that business are being paid out. 
   
   The problem with this is that the whole business is just a part of the equation. You're not the person making the decisions.


## Dutch join backlash at expensive drugs by making their own
- > A recent article [1] suggests that the U.S. is not a better investment in drugs. In the case of the United States, they're still not a worse investment in drugs. But, for instance, a more expensive country has a much more efficient and safer place, than the US has. 
   
   This isn't the same with France. The cost of drugs is a higher than the cost of drugs. 
   
   [1] https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-u-s-cost-of-drug-addicting-drugs-that-are-the-most-importants-from-legal-legal_story/


- > _The U.S. is also very well equipped with many more powerful drugs, but there is no way to do it in the US._ 
   
   The article is not very clear. Is the UK a better alternative?


- This was a great article. The article says he did not have to work a few hours a week (in the UK) because the drug costs were lower than normal and there were many cases where a drug costs as high as $100 (for an example of $500 for a drug). 
   
   This seems to imply that the author is being too optimistic about his future.


- I don't see how it is possible for a doctor to have a pill that will be used as a placebo to prescribe an amphetamine. 
   
   The FDA is probably going to get a lot of money out of this.


- This is a big deal for me. I am currently working as an EU doctor and I think the US has become a very strong force behind what is considered a drug. The FDA is a very strong force that makes you feel good to yourself and your patients. If you are a good doctor, you will feel better. The FDA's are a very strict and very good thing to me. The FDA doesn't have to pay for the drug and the FDA doesn't care about it. 
   
   I would like to see the EU and the FDA get involved. I'm a Canadian and I have a lot of respect for the FDA. 
   
   I would also like to see a study from the US to the USA to see if the government is really making it better.


## Web Scraping with Electron
- There are plenty of interesting and helpful tools in this field to work out of, but the only one I've had trouble with is using an old version of the API, and using some old API. 
   
   That's a lot of work, I'll be giving this a try!


- The author of this article is not a big fan of the fact that it's not really a web developer but a developer with the right skills to write a web app. That would be very useful to see someone write a native app that will be able to use this.


- What does this mean for Google's scraping engine?


- The "why" in the title is misleading - it's just a summary of how it works. I'd say it's a bit off the mark, but as it stands, the "what" is "what" in the title should be "Why," which is just a way of saying, "why," and that should be "how."


- I think I'll stick with the idea of using the same approach in my current project: https://scraper.com/ (which has a good interface for this). It's a bit easier for me to just do a few things in the DOM with a nice way to quickly get data out of the browser. 
   
   I don't have a lot of experience with scraping, but this looks to be something that I'd want to learn from.


## A generalised solution to distributed consensus
- This is interesting to me. The author seems to have done some work in the field. The article says he's a big fan of distributed systems, and has the most interesting idea. 
   
   However, his first post is a good overview. I've found that he has a great insight into distributed systems that has been a huge help in keeping up with the hype for distributed systems. I've been trying to understand distributed systems, so I can't say I'd like to see the article as part of an introductory article.


- What if you're using this library? I've been thinking about the same thing.


- What does it mean to be able to write a distributed system that is consistent with a distributed system? Is it something that I've seen? 
   
   Does it mean that a distributed system is distributed, or is it just a distributed system? I'm genuinely curious to know about what the benefits of distributed computing are, and how much of this stuff is just an implementation detail.


- The article doesn't explain the problem of distributed systems, or the fact that the distributed systems are distributed (i.e. distributed) in an attempt to solve the same problem. 
   
   The problem is that if the distributed systems are distributed then the distributed systems need to be distributed. That is the reason why centralized systems are so complex, and that's the real problem in distributed systems in the first place. 
   
   The problem is the lack of distributed systems. The real solution is to make distributed systems easy to scale, because people are willing to put more resources into it, because distributed systems are inherently distributed.


- It's funny to see the comments here on HN, where I was a bit disappointed with the post and the comments on the blog. 
   
   I really like the fact that the author is saying that he's trying to solve problems that we have a real problem with, and has been around for a lot of time and it has been a very interesting read. 
   
   I don't like the idea. I don't see why you're going for it. There are plenty of other things that are more interesting. I don't think there are any other things to be said about the problem that have been solved, or that you don't want to solve it. 
   
   I also think that the article was confusing. The author seems to be trying to solve a problem with a problem, which I think is more interesting to me. 
   
   I'd like to see a comparison of how the author was able to get a sense of how many people actually have solved a problem, but I think the problem is actually the fact that he doesn't seem to have a problem in that he doesn't really seem to be solving. It looks to me like he's trying to solve a problem.


## MathML in Chromium
- What is the point of the "MathML"? It seems like this is basically a "new syntax" for a language that already does a lot of the same things.


- What's the license on Github? This seems to imply that a "license" is not available, but I'm not sure what the license is.


- This is great! Thanks for sharing


- I've been playing around with some math for the last couple of years, but the biggest problem is not a library, but a library, not a library. There are many, many libraries out there that can help me make MathML easier for me. 
   
   I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be so great for me.


- The only one thing holding me back is the "Math.floor" function, which I'm not sure I understand.


## The AI-Art Gold Rush Is Here
- I think this article is spot on, but the article is not about the "why" of the market and the "why." The "why" is "why": it makes you think about how it might actually work. 
   
   The real issue is that the market is not "why" or "why"; it's "why." The market can be different and different.


- A lot of this is due to how well they do it. It is a very good article, and if you are interested in a more practical approach to this subject, the link I posted (http://www.quantcast.com/quantcasts/).


- I don't know why people think it is so easy to make a "good" graphic design.


- A friend (or two) has been working with it, and I can't find the link to the original site, but it's a good idea. I think it's a great idea.


- A little off topic, but the article is a great example of the problem of a bubble in itself, and not just a way of saying "It doesn't have to come from anywhere." 
   
   It's not like there's any way of making it happen. 
   
   The author's examples seem to have more to do with the fact that there is no way of telling the truth.


## Sick marine mammals turning up on California beaches
- This is pretty fascinating. I wonder if it's because of the fact that the US has a large population of people who grew up in the suburbs of the Midwest (I'm talking about the population at this point). 
   
   The only way to get this is to have a population of people who have lived in the suburbs who are not very good at what their kids did, and they're likely not to be able to afford a family to live in, which I suspect is what's causing the situation.


- I'm glad that they did not use the word "homicides" and "food," which is also not in the article. It's a little misleading as to why a lot of people here are saying "the food isn't a food" (in fact, I believe it is). The article does not even explain what the point is. It seems like a lot of people are just saying this is a "problem," and it is a good way to start making the same arguments about the fact that a lot of people don't actually care and that the article is a bit off.


- "A new kind of food" is what we do to prevent food from eating, and we can't help but think it's a good idea.


- There is an interesting video about this that talks about how they can make a "big fish" with the same ingredients: 
   
   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9CK_KC5KJK0


- This seems a bit too much like a "good" idea. It would be nice if someone could make this happen on the street and then have it be used to get the water off and on top of it.


## “It's done in hardware so it's cheap” (2012)
- > _The first step in hardware design is the ability to have a computer and a computer on the same network for you._ 
   
   > _"There are two types of computer design: one for your personal computer, one for your home computer. The one for your laptop, the other for your laptop, and the one for your laptop..."_ 
   
   > _The first, the second, the fourth, the third, and the fourth, the third, and the third are the most powerful computers. They can be replaced with a new computer, and the third one can be replaced with a new computer._ 
   
   The first is the best computer design, the third one, the third one. 
   
   > _It's not a PC, and it's a PC with a PC._ 
   
   I'm sure the author is aware that "computers" are the most powerful computer design tools. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be buying them. If you don't use them, don't buy them. If you buy them, don't buy them at all. If you buy them at all, you'll probably buy them at most, and it will cost you nothing _ 
   
   I agree that


- I'd be curious to know whether the author has ever used a computer as a hobby or not - the article doesn't mention how to use an embedded computer for a living.


- "It would have been nice if you knew that we had to be a programmer to do this." 
   
   That is one thing that I think is a pretty clear statement that is often overlooked in this blog. The article is very vague on what he was actually trying to say, but is actually about the actual product. 
   
   There was some interesting reading about the "why" for this post (which is why the article is titled 'Why the Mac is better at X than the iPhone'). In the article it seems that the author is talking about the "how to run the OS" part of the OS and how to write an OS on a Mac. 
   
   I think this is a pretty clear statement and the article is not about OS / 2, but about how to use the "why" of the "why" (which is an odd choice).


- This article doesn't explain what a "real" computer is. It's not a computer, it's an operating system. There are plenty of ways to make a computer that will run on the phone. 
   
   But that's a pretty good article, and I'm a little disappointed that the article doesn't include anything that isn't mentioned here.


- I've been following this story before, and I have not found any good examples of this. 
   
   What would be really useful is if you had to have an FPGA for the same task at the same time, but instead of the different hardware components, you could have an FPGA, and have a FPGA in your house in front of you to do it yourself.


## Show HN: My CV is also a bootloader
- This is awesome.


- I like the idea, but the design is not great. I'd love to see a sample of the skills and skills used in my resume.


- This is a cool idea. The first thing that came to mind after reading through the description was how much of an improvement this would have taken.


- Great idea. 
   
   The website is very confusing. It looks like you're using "Email:" to "Email:" which is not clear to me what the service does. 
   
   I'm not sure how it's different from a normal LinkedIn or LinkedIn resume, or if it's just a LinkedIn profile or something, but the site seems to be broken. It looks like you've made a copy of the LinkedIn profile, with the "Email:" in the footer. 
   
   Edit: You might also make a nice landing page with the "Email:" button to the "Email:" button.


- Looks awesome! 
   
   A couple of things: 
   
   * I have the same problem, I don't see a reason that I should have to do the email. 
   
   * The email is sent to me via my web site.


## How to pass a programming interview (2016)
- I'm a bit surprised the author didn't mention that you're asking questions that have already been asked on stackoverflow. It would seem like the answer is: 
   
   _ _ _ _ _* ("What's a good way to solve a problem in this area?")_ _ _ * ("What does a good way to solve the problem in this area?") 
   
   I don't understand the "Why" section on SO, it sounds like the author has been looking for a specific programming language or language for years and it has been asked before ("How would I write an app in X, Y, and Z?").


- This is a great resource - especially if you can get some insight on how the candidate works. For me, this is more about getting to the point where I can learn from their code (which is great, if you do) than it is about how they know how to code (which is not to say I'm a bad programmer, though!). 
   
   I'd recommend that you get the following advice: 
   
   - don't worry about getting into interviews, because you'll probably get more out of them. I'd probably give a lot more of this advice if you can find someone who will help you get a job that is easier to get to. 
   
   - Don't ask questions in interviews, because if you have the chance to work with them, you don't have a reason to work with them, so if you have no problem finding someone to do a little bit of coding, don't worry about hiring someone that's already doing them. 
   
   - Be aware that you're hiring the candidate to solve your problem. They should also be willing to pay for you (and possibly pay you more for the interview) so they can get the job. I'm sure they can afford the extra work to


- I'd say that if the interviewer was a good candidate and the candidate had a great interview process, the interviewer would probably be better off asking someone who has done the same and the same. 
   
   However, if I were an interviewer, my interview questions would be a lot more informative than if the candidate's interview was in fact about a candidate's coding skills and a programming skill that is a little easier to read than what the interview process is doing, and would have been much easier to follow through and explain. 
   
   I would argue that it is more important to have a good interview process than the one you are interviewing. If you are interviewing someone with your company, you should have a good understanding of the problem and why they want you to think about solving it and how to solve it.


- The article is very well written and well written. I'd love to have someone write up the same sort of code.


- This is a pretty cool list. I would be curious to see more on this sort of thing.


## The Man with an Elephant’s Nose
- I'm a huge fan of this guy.


- This is the reason we're so scared in the future when we can't even have a real conversation with someone.


- This is one of those things that I don't think people are going to have fun playing with, because it's not just a fun hobby to play. I've been thinking about doing this myself lately and it's great to hear that someone has a bit of experience in the field of technology.


- This guy should have done a good job of explaining this stuff to the rest of the people who are trying to get their head around the issue.


- I was a little confused by his conclusion. 
   
   He is a guy who doesn't know about the guy's body. He has the skin to get around the problem that his body doesn't have the hair. 
   
   He says: 
   
   
  ... but he does, and he says: "So, he can't tell me what to do with this."


## CDC: Low-income parents send sick kids to school due to lack paid sick leave
- The most interesting thing to come out of the article is that it doesn't mention how much the US needs to do to keep people from taking the extra $$$$$.


- This is a terrible article. It doesn't actually make any sense. 
   
   If you want to live in a country where a lot of people are in poverty and want a high level of income, you should be able to live in a very low cost country where you are free to live. 
   
   I'm a bit of a child and I've seen this in my career. But in the end, my kids get a higher education and a higher education. 
   
   It's the same for me - I'm not going to go back to school, but I can do my homework, and I can get the job done. It's my responsibility, not my responsibility.


- The headline doesn't say anything about that. The article says that "Americans were not allowed to live for the rest of their lives without a college degree" and doesn't even mention the fact that this is the case for all students in the US. 
   
   The article does say "Americans are allowed to work for the most part of their life" but doesn't mention how that is the case. 
   
   It's also interesting to note that Americans are not allowed to do basic work, and that the average American is not allowed to work for the most part of their life. 
   
   The study says that the average American has about a 50% chance at working for the most part of their lives - in fact, this means that most Americans don't have to work in the United States for a living.


- "A lot of young people have no idea who they are, but I have found that many older people do not think that they are the only one in the room." 
   
   The article is wrong, and doesn't make this claim. 
   
   In general, I think the more interesting thing to me is that the number of people with the most experience in their field (in the UK) is much higher than the number of people with the most money in the field. 
   
   It seems to me that most of the people in the industry, with the most money in the fields, have a hard drive for a job, and a job. In fact, I'm not saying this is the best case, it seems to me, though.


- What if it's in the middle of the night where you are a kid?


## Whither Speech Recognition? (1969) [pdf]
- The first part of the article was pretty good, but the first part is really good: 
   
   "This is an important topic that is important to our understanding of the subject, the main reason we are still using it is that it is very hard to understand the implications of the technology, the main problem is that our understanding of our current state of affairs is not that different from our understanding of our current state of affairs, but that we have a very large set of rules that make it harder for us to understand. We are in a very different world, and we are able to do a better job of understanding and understanding our thoughts, even if you are not familiar with the subject." 
   
   The second part is interesting. I'm very curious to see how many years we have been in a period of time in which technology has become an important thing to our understanding of the current state of our lives. 
   
   I'm curious to know how much we have learned from the last few years, and if we are going to be learning about our current state of affairs and technology.


- "In the 1960s, the American Dream, the first of all, was a computer program in 1981." 
   
   I thought the first is the most interesting one.


- This article doesn't even mention what it was about: "The Snowdens of the Internet." That is what it is. 
   
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snows_in_the_future_of_the 
   
   "The Internet of Things - the Internet of Things by the way - is an amazing tool to learn and create the future of the human experience." 
   
   "It has to be an amazing thing, and I can't imagine it being used in any meaningful way, and I can't imagine it being used for anything. It is a beautiful and exciting and exciting thing, and I'm not a fan of it. It has to be an amazing thing. It's not just a tool to learn, but an amazing thing that makes it so much easier to learn. That's why we can't just do things with the information we already know and do."


- What's the most important part of the text?


- The article's conclusion is wrong. The human brain was a machine, not machine.


## Ask HN: Where should I start as a 34-year-old switching to software as a career?
- I was in an early 20s where it was very difficult to get a job. It seemed like you just had a job and were in the right place to make it happen. It was a very difficult decision for you to make. 
   
   I think this was a great time, as I had some friends and family who did the same. 
   
   I was a big fan of the job, but I'm still a little surprised at the amount of work and effort involved in it. I was also very happy to have found a job at a big company for my own personal reasons.


- I'm a senior developer who's been freelancing for about 4 years. I don't think the pay is that high, but I'm sure that if you are in the US, you can start a new job for yourself.


- I'm a senior software engineer and my first startup was a startup, and I'm working on a product for the startup that will make money from the start. I've also made a few friends who have made an app for them that helps them to build a startup. 
   
   The main problem that is that you won't be a "senior engineer" and will have to be an engineer, you won't know what to do, and that's what you're looking for. You will be able to pick up a new language and build a prototype, which will make it even more challenging. I'm also looking for a co-founder, who is looking for a co-founder and is a full-time employee with a full-time job, but I'm not sure I would get an early exit. 
   
   Good luck!


- If you want to make a change in your mind, it's hard to find a job. 
   
   You might also want to try to be more specific on the job, or perhaps find a new job. 
   
   You could also look to the other options, like being a freelance contractor. If they are looking for an internship, you might have something to do with them and if you have some work experience, you might also get another gig. 
   
   Good luck. I hope you find something to do with this.


- Do you have any experience with working at Google? It sounds like you're not the only developer at Google. 
   
   I know a few folks in the industry who did this. They were all young and didn't have to worry about anything. I don't know what they did to get them to switch to a full-time gig. It sounds like you have an awesome time. You'll need a job and a lot of experience to be able to learn and grow. You may be able to do more with that time. 
   
   If you're still learning new technologies (or are in demand), I can't imagine you're ever going to do that again at Google. You're going to find your dream job. You'll probably want to find something you can do with it. You'll learn a lot in the process.


## Cloudy with a Chance of War (2014)
- I have a question: 
   
   Does this mean that there will be a lot of people who do something about it to make a living out of it? (Or, to put it another way, it's not that they're bad)?


- It's a little weird that he's using a single "secret" method for the sake of having the "secret" method for his own purposes ("it's like" the secret "method for this purpose). 
   
   I suppose it's nice to have a" secret "method for the" secret "part but that's not exactly something I'd be able to use for anything other than a" secret "(" secret, "or" secret, "etc.)


- I think the author should just say, "I don't know if I'll ever go back." 
   
   I'd rather be on the front page of HN and have more time on the front pages.


- This post has been killed and has killed.


- A bit of a tangent but I have to ask this question: why would anyone want to be on the receiving end of the "Internet"? It doesn't seem like an appropriate thing to ask for.


## If We Blow Up an Asteroid, It Might Put Itself Back Together
- "The Earth is now the largest planet in the world." 
   
   I thought it was a good article, but I think it was a mistake to make this claim.


- I don't understand the obsession with nuclear power here. What is that supposed to be about? 
   
   I've read the article and I'm sure we could find some way to make it more effective. But it was just about the size of the earth, and the size of the moon.


- I was wondering what this thing would do to the earth. If the moon were a small space with a big, then it would need a little more space than it would need to be to orbit itself. 
   
   If I was a kid, I would probably want to build an entire planet in my spare time, but if I was not a kid, it would need to be something that would be very easy to do in a relatively short time. 
   
   If the moon's mission was a tiny orbit, the earth could only be a small portion of the earth's surface. I don't want to spend the energy I would need to do this with my own life, or even have that energy be put into space.


- It's a shame that the US is so desperate to make this stuff so cheap and useful.


- I would have loved to see an article about what a "solar system" would be like...


## H-1B: Outsourcer HCL games visa system to discriminate against non-South Asians
- I'm not sure what's the point, but I can't seem to find any details on the actual data or the numbers.


- I am a Canadian, and the only reason I can say that I am in the US is due to a very limited immigration policy and the amount of work I have to pay. 
   
   I can tell you that this is an undesirable situation for Americans, but the problem with immigration is that most immigrants in my country are in the top 1% of the population who live in Europe (not the majority), or those whose income is below 1%. 
   
   In this case (and it seems like I have been able to tell that this article is a bit light on the fact that this is the only reason that this country is so bad, and it makes it very difficult to find a decent visa in the first place. 
   
   My impression is that if the immigration laws are not in place, the majority of immigrants who immigrate in the US are already in the top 1% of the U.S., and thus have no idea what the chances are for foreigners in Canada, and they are in the top 1%, who are currently in the top 0.1% of Americans, and who are in the top 1%? 
   
   If the H1B laws are not going to work, I'd be very interested to hear the results in what


- The "H1B" is the one that's not the case with the H1-B.


- This is the best way to get H1B visa. 
   
   I'm a US citizen in the US and have been working in both the tech sector and the tech sector for a while now. It was a great experience. 
   
   My main beef was that the H1B program has to be in the top 10. It was not that hard at the US, but it was just as painful, as it seems like it was.


- What a great initiative, and an excellent idea. 
   
   I wish I could get more people to apply in the U.S. I hope that the immigration program could help people find their jobs elsewhere in the world, so that more people could learn from them.


## US citizens will need a visa to visit Europe starting in 2021
- If they're going to go the other way, this is just another example. The US government is a country with a lot of debt, and the government is not a big enough place to go. 
   
   But it's a great country that doesn't have much of a culture that doesn't have a lot of wealth to pay.


- "I think the main difference between a European and Europe's citizens and the U.S. is that there are many Americans that live in countries that have not been visited." 
   
   This article is very true. The article does say the US, and the UK is a country that is, to a lesser extent, a European country, a European country which is not a part of a US economy. However I find it interesting that the article doesn't mention that Europe is not an country that is a part of a country that is, to a lesser extend, a country that was designed for the U.S., is a country which is a country whose sole purpose is to make its own countries, not a country which has been built in the past.


- It seems like we have to take the opposite tack and not the one that is actually the problem. The problem with the U.S. is that it's difficult for the US to get a Visa, because it requires a degree, and it requires a lot more experience with the Visa.


- I've been thinking of a more interesting idea - a system where the country is able to get a job and get a job in a country where it could be a lot of people. 
   
   I'm thinking of an idea that I might get a job that will let me work remotely for free. I have a family and a spouse (a few years, and have been doing freelance work) and my wife and I have a friend who works for a company. My partner has a very basic business background (I think that will give some perspective on this), and we have no plans to work remotely, and we want to be able to work remotely for the company in a country of a large number of countries.


- I'm not sure the article is going to be useful to a majority of the population (or any of them). I would be interested to see the numbers, for example: (
   
   1) In the UK, the government is paying a small percentage of the population. (2) The government is paying a small amount of taxes (3) The tax payer is paying a small fraction of the tax on the tax benefits. (4) The government also pays a small amount of the taxes in the US. (5) The tax payer also spends a lot of their money for its citizens and is not taxed. (7) 
   
   I have no doubt that the government can find a way to make it more difficult for the public to tax the income.


## Gone in six seconds? Exploiting car alarms
- I have a friend who's used to driving cars on a highway and was on the road for about 10 years (not in a car) and he was driving for the same amount of time. He was a car driver who was not at the intersection and the speed limit for cars was too low. He had to wait until the car stopped (not because of a collision course) and the engine was not able to get around the intersection.


- This is one of the reasons I use a car, I have been trying to get a car for a while now and I have been very happy with a car. I am not an accident, but I have found the accident to be much harder than it looks to be.


- This article doesn't seem to explain the situation (and the author doesn't explain why). 
   
   The author states that it does not require the user to unlock the car, but it does mention that it is possible to use a car as an example for the accident and to have them unlock that car to unlock the car. So he's assuming that it's a real driver, not a real driver. 
   
   The article is also a great example why this is a real car issue. There's a lot of stuff that can be done to help people with the car.


- This is one reason why I'm going to buy a new car, especially if it's a car. When I drive a car, I have to make sure that I don't turn on my car to go back to the bathroom. The first time I do this I always try to avoid the car because it's so convenient, and when I get back, I'm always going to have to turn off the car again. When I get back to my car I get to see the car on a bus or car and the car can't turn off the light, and I'm not sure if they're a good thing, or it's just not the same thing. But in this case, the car's battery is not the same as my bike.


- A friend of mine has a car that can be turned on if it's plugged in. It is a bit like a regular car, but with a lot more functionality.


## Proton Technologies awarded €2M from the EU
- I'd have liked to see the "EU-European" part more like a 'European'. In my mind, the European market is more 'American' and more likely to get to the point where they could afford to go for more. 
   
   I wonder what the EU is going to do for a few years.


- There are also other places in the world that do the same. One where you can get a nice and simple web of information from a few sources. For example, the BBC is a very good source on the matter.


- This was posted a few days ago, with a very interesting story about how they were able to make the UK a better choice for the EU's economy than the rest of Europe. 
   
   http://globaleconomics.com/2014/04/26/european-economics-vs-european-economics/why-do-european-economics-and-politics/#comment-184476


- It seems like the US has a lot of debt to begin with. I wonder how much it's worth?


- I wonder how many of those countries have already done this. I'm sure that some countries would be interested in making a similar move to the EU. The fact that the EU doesn't have an "international" program, I wonder if we can have a "foreign" program that is more like a startup.


## Mino Games (YC W11) Is Hiring a Lead Back End Engineer in Montreal, QC
- I don't know how the app works, but if the app is open source and you're on your team, I've noticed it on GitHub, and I've been trying to figure out how to use it for this. 
   
   This might be a better approach than the existing game dev teams where they are trying to make money, but they have no way of knowing how much money the team will spend. 
   
   I know I've had the opportunity to work with some great developers, but I've also noticed that there are so many other companies that have made a mistake, that I'm not sure they have the time to make it. And I'm not sure if these companies have a good chance of doing this.


- I don't think the game industry is going to be as big a challenge for startups as it was for the first time, as I've heard a few times that it's a big problem.


- It's great to see more startups using this, and the YC startup team. I think they can be a very successful business to begin with. 
   
   One thing I don't understand about this approach is how people will pay attention to what their company is doing in a specific way - if they can get the money out of their pocket, they should have done it. 
   
   I've found a lot of companies that are looking for developers with an interest in games and game theory that they will pay attention to. The fact that the app itself was a bit of an exercise in frustration, I think it would be a good thing to have an app for that kind of thing, especially given the amount of money they have.


- This is a great idea and a good execution. One thing that I think will be interesting to see is the fact that there is a company with no employees and they are all in on a great start up. 
   
   If they do decide to go the way of the startup, and are going the other way, I can see that they are trying to get in on the next round of companies that can't find a new job. 
   
   I am not sure how the idea of applying for a job is different from how the company was created. I am sure there is a startup in the space that could help. If they are in the Bay Area or have a job, that would be great.


- I love that a startup is so hard and hard to recruit and that they are willing to hire anyone that wants to do a startup for them is a very hard problem to solve.


## JavaScript Fatigue: Realities of our industry (2017)
- The most interesting thing is that in the last few years (and I think that was the case for me), I have been programming professionally for the last 20 + years. The language is pretty easy to learn, and it really is quite easy to learn. And it's still a very difficult problem to tackle and I'm not sure if this is because I'm too lazy to do it in my spare time. I think there's a lot to learn from this and I'm glad to see this. 
   
   One thing I don't understand about Javascript is, I don't really know what is the language that's supposed to be the most used language for it.


- I have a feeling that the author will be very frustrated at this.


- > _The most difficult problem is that the code in a browser is not really readable. The problem is that it's a pain and you can't really get it working._ 
   
   This is the problem with JS frameworks.


- I don't think this is a new article. I think there's a difference between "JS vs JS vs JavaScript" and "JavaScript vs Javascript / ES6 / etc." 
   
   The same is why JS is great. I've been trying to use it for some projects and it's been very easy (and easy) to learn and build.


- It's interesting to see that this isn't a post about JavaScript's "best practices" (the one that's still used in the JavaScript community). 
   
   I've always liked Javascript's style of code (e.g., "I need to do everything in JavaScript"). 
   
   But the article is a good summary. The best code in JavaScript is the one that's still written by a developer, but is not written by someone else (or by someone).


## Intellectual Denial of Service Attacks, Part 2
- I am really not sure if it is an attack that makes me feel like the NSA is trying to kill a lot of these attacks. 
   
   I mean, I'm a fan. But how much do you think that is the point of the law? If you are talking about the NSA, why can't there be a law against it for you? 
   
   If you want to be part of that government, you are in trouble: You cannot have the government, you can just be the person responsible for the government. If you want to get the government to act on your behalf, you cannot have the government act as you would like it, you cannot have the government act as you are. 
   
   I am not saying this should be done as long as it is legal or not. The US is the most corrupt place.


- The article states that if a government is trying to break a law into private property, they are trying to stop an unconstitutional law, or that they are trying to stop a government, they are doing it, and that is why the system has been designed to stop them. 
   
   So the question is: is there a law that prevents them from doing things like the following: 
   
   1) a law that does something illegal 
   
   2) a government or a federal court 
   
   3) a law requiring that government be able to do things legally 
   
   4) law requiring that law be passed by law 
   
   5) law requiring the law be granted to law enforcement 
   
   6) a law requiring that law be allowed for public property 
   
   6) law requiring a law being signed 
   
   7) law requiring that law be enforceable 
   
   8) law requiring the law be granted in secret 
   
   7) law requiring that the law be signed by the law be granted to the public.


- I'm sure that it is a joke, but what does this "secret" mean?


- The only thing that I don't like, is the way the article says it all: 
   
   _ _In an election season, the U.S. is getting to the end of the election year - it's about getting the election to be in the U.S. - in a way that's not as much of a problem as a solution to the election._ _


- I was under the impression that the article was written with a very strong argument against the use of this word. I think this is a pretty important distinction. 
   
   The "real" meaning of the phrase "real" is the word "real" and "real" is the term "fake." 
   
   The actual usage of "real," and "real" means "real," doesn't really mean "real." There are some things that are not real, like some sort of physical object or a "real" or "real," or "fake." The "real" meaning of the word "real" is the term "real and" real and "real." The "real" meaning of "real" is something that is used very often to refer to people. It does mean, you know, to be real. 
   
   I think this is one of the reasons the term "fake" means the word, which is used very often by people who know the word, but are not very good. 
   
   I think this argument is a bit too broad. There are many more, and many more, and it is a little too broad a distinction between what the word "real" and


## Live coding a basic Go compiler with LLVM in 20 minutes
- This looks very interesting to me. It seems to be an implementation of a "compiler" (the same as an implementation of an interpreter) that is essentially a static type system, but with a different runtime type system. 
   
   I have no interest at this stage in this area, but I'd be interested in hearing about the performance impact of the compiler.


- This is a great writeup.


- I think it's pretty obvious that this is a C + + compiler. 
   
   It's a bit sad that there's no mention of C. I'm pretty sure C + + is a pretty good replacement for C in some cases, since there's no real reason to use C in a language that has a better standard library.


- > It is also possible to get a good feel for the amount of C + + code in the code. 
   
   I can't find a good reason to use gcc for this. I don't see why they're trying to use it for C, and how they are using it. They seem to have a lot of code to write, but they don't really say that it's possible to build it for them.


- The author's comments on comments are interesting and all, but this is just a summary of the project's project. 
   
   The code itself looks interesting and a lot of people don't have time to learn the basics. However, I've learned a lot from it, and I'll definitely give it a go. Thanks for sharing this.


## SpaceX Crew Dragon Splashes Down After Historic Test Flight
- This article does not say why the landing was delayed.


- I hope I'm wrong... I'm surprised they didn't get into the space again. I'm a bit worried that this is a "real" event.


- I can't believe that NASA has been able to put a rocket into orbit.


- So, is it possible to have two engines in the same orbit that could be landed in the same position as each other?


- I hope they're not going to go back to the Apollo missions.


## Updates from YC
- I've been following this for a while as well. It's great to see how many things you guys've got and I'm going to have to wait a few weeks for it to come up.


- > _The idea that YC will be able to fund itself is absurd. We're not in our early stages, but we'll be around the same time, or maybe we'll be around the same time._ 
   
   I'm a bit confused by the whole idea about what YC is supposed to do. Are they asking for money to fund themselves? What is the benefit? Why are they asking for money? What are the risks? Are they asking for money? 
   
   Also, it seems like they are asking for money, and not just because of how much they want to make.


- If you're interested in joining a startup, you might want to check out the YC W14 [1] program that was featured on HN yesterday: 
   
   
   "I'm not sure if the program has been successful, but it's definitely been successful" 
   
   It's a nice program and a great learning experience, but there's also an interesting question to ask when YC has a better chance of success. 
   
   There are some good ideas in here but a very limited number of applications are going to be funded, but I suspect YC's success will be more than just an idea.

- What's with the "I don't want to see the big picture" in the post? 
   
   > We're in the process of launching the first batch of YC applications 
   
   I've always thought they were in a good state of the art, but I have never thought about that.


- I was just wondering if anyone is willing to give YC the chance to do this. Is it just the YC partners?

   This is a feature that is a bug that is just another bug. If your code is not broken, the bug is still there. If it isn't, there's no way to fix it. 
   
   If it's not broken, there's still no real way. The bug is a problem. If it doesn't, there's no way to remove it.


- > In the paper's paper, it states that a pointer can be used with a sequence of integers and therefore the memory is a finite object. 
   
   That's not true, in my experience. I'm in the middle of an algorithm I worked in that was used to determine if the memory is finite. The result was a sequence of integers, which we didn't expect, and we knew how to do. 
   
   I've been doing a fair bit of research on this topic and I can't help but notice the author's name on this one, and the paper seems to have the same exact name as the paper (which I'm not sure about.) 
   
   I'd guess that it would be better if the author did a comparison of the two (or more), but that doesn't seem to explain it. In fact, a lot of the papers were done with a simple solution to a problem of how to solve it, and how to do it.


- I think this article is missing the point. 
   
   The author seems to be using a very different algorithm: it's not just "write" (and "read") but, for the reasons he mentioned, "write" is not an O (1) operation, and that the memory of each function is not the same as the O (log (log (log (log (log (log n)) + log (log)))). It's a constant in memory and therefore a "write" is a constant, and the "read" is not an O (log (log (log n, log (log n)))). 
   
   This is the same as the "write" method (that is, "log (log (log n) + log n))) is the O (log n) operation. The result is a sequence of" write, "" write, "" write, "" write. "This is what happens after you write your function. 
   
   In the end it was a" write, "and not a" write. "


- What's a good way to do it? The "real" solution is a lot simpler and simpler. The "real" solution is to just do everything that is in the memory, and not just do anything in the memory, but make sure it is the correct one that is the correct one. 
   
   The problem is not that you don't need all the extra work (and the problem is that you have to do the rest of your work in parallel), it's that you don't have the whole "real" thing in the memory, and instead you have to be able to do what I need on my machine and the rest of the machine. It's because the "real" thing is the same as the "real" thing and not the "real" part.


- The author doesn't seem to have a lot of knowledge at his disposal. In my mind, this is an example of how much information is shared between the computer and the programmer.


## Myequifax.com Bypasses Credit Freeze Pin
- I have to wonder if this is just an excuse in the wrong part of the world. I think that a good chunk of the market for online banking is the financial industry.


- It's not that hard to just get a credit card. I know the guy who made the decision to buy a credit card. It's not that hard to find a credit card. 
   
   He was in the market for a few years, and the market was flooded. The market had a big problem. I'd have to pay to have them. 
   
   The problem is that there aren't enough banks in the world to make the money. There is still a lot of people that just want a credit card and don't want to have to worry about a credit card. If the system were to be used to solve a large problem, the money could be made. If the system is not a problem and it would be an easy thing to do with cash, it could be the same thing as buying the money from one of them. 
   
   I'm sure there are plenty of people who want to use credit cards, but in my experience the people who want to spend money don't.


- This is a good lesson for all businesses. If you can't pay cash for your services or your products, you're screwed. If you're not paying cash, you'll just get it back. 
   
   If the banks don't have a "payment processing program," I don't think they will be able to do this. I would be surprised if the bank didn't make this. 
   
   As for the bank, I think this article is an attempt to make money out of thin air.


- So what happens if you get a refund?


- I wonder if the "card" is the "card" they are selling to them?


## Using TensorFlow to detect fish species
- I think this is a really cool project, but there's nothing that really makes the project seem like it would be useful at all to have it do more than just "deep learning." I'm wondering why they are not using the TensorFlow library instead of a traditional Python library like TensorFlow and TensorFlow.


- This is awesome! 
   
   I'm a huge fan of the project, and am excited to see where this will play out. 
   
   The project is very cool, but I think this project needs more work to do, so it should be very difficult to make the work to work on a project. It'd be nice for a little research on how this could be used in production.


- This reminds me of the time you had to write a compiler to do this in C, then you could do the compiler in Java and you could do it in C. This way you could just make the compiler compile a bit of the code. You'd then be able to write a whole JIT compiler for the compiler and it could compile it into a bytecode that you had never imagined existed before, and you could run it on an ARM machine, like that in C. 
   
   The compiler would have to use a different compiler and then compile the LLVM bytecode, which would also run the JIT code. So, for example, you could write a compiler that would generate a JIT compiler, and you could build a JIT compiler. 
   
   The same thing happens with the x86 emulator. You'd have to run it on x86 (x86) with x86 as well, and that's how you run a compiler.


- Is there an API to do this? I'm looking for an API for the GPU. 
   
   EDIT: This seems the source code: https://github.com/lkp/llkml


- It would be great if you could have a more complete understanding of the difference between the two, with a clear explanation for why it works.
